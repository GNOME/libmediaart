NEW in 1.9.0 - 2014-10-17
=========================

  * Fixes: GB#722795, tracker should not scatter .mediaartlocal folders across filesystem
  * Fixes: GB#724879, Add async calls

NOTE:

  This RELEASE COMPLETELY BREAKS API/ABI on nearly all functions and
  is incompatible with the 1.0 series of releases (the last being
  0.7.0).

  This unstable release is in preparation for the libmediaart-2.0
  series of releases. The version being < 2.0 is purely because 2.0
  will be considered stable.

  From this point on, the API is not expected to change by any large
  amount from what is defined in these releases.


NEW in 0.7 - 2014-09-22
=======================

  * Fixes: GB#727478, artist, title and prefix arguments in get_file should

  * build: include m4 dir parsing
  * tests: Use tap automake testing scripts, fixes output summaries
  * doap: add <programming-language> and 'core' category
  * extract: Fixed process_buffer() len check (was inverted) and artist/title

NOTE:

  This RELEASE BREAKS API/ABI from 0.5.0, return value for
  media_art_get_path() is now a gboolean, not void.


NEW in 0.5 - 2014-07-28
=======================

  * Fixes: GB#731678, Heuristics does not handle uppercase properly
  * build: Require glib 2.38 for g_assert_true() in unit tests

  * extract: Switch to initable MediaArtProcess object  from _init/_shutdown()
  * extract: Split _process() API into  _process_buffer() and _process_file()
  * extract: Make GFile first parameter for _process_file()
  * extract: Add _SYMLINK_FAILED error and report symlink() failure in get_heuristic()
  * extract: Add GError for _NO_TITLE, which is required in some cases
  * extract: Add GError * reporting right down to the plugins (pixbuf/qt)
  * extract: Use a more logical ordered heuristic for caching strings
  * extract: Refactor media_art_process_file() to simplify the function
  * storage: Make g_message() calls g_debug() calls, output is unnecessary
  * docs: Fixed Makefile so we don't fail on distcheck with --enable-gtk-doc
  * tests: Don't expect media art extraction for NULL data buffer for !images
  * tests: Test for no error with media_art_process_file() with real use case

NOTE:

  This RELEASE BREAKS API/ABI from 0.4.0.

NEW in 0.1 - 2013-11-01

First release!

The code for this project has been extracted from Tracker and inserted into
