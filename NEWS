  * Fixes: GB#731678, Heuristics does not handle uppercase properly
  * build: Require glib 2.38 for g_assert_true() in unit tests
  * build: Updated configure.ac from autoscan suggestions
  * build: Improve warnings used when compiling and test compiler warnings we can use
  * extract: Switch to initable MediaArtProcess object  from _init/_shutdown()
  * extract: Split _process() API into  _process_buffer() and _process_file()
  * extract: Make GFile first parameter for _process_file()
  * extract: Add _SYMLINK_FAILED error and report symlink() failure in get_heuristic()
  * extract: Add GError for _NO_TITLE, which is required in some cases
  * extract: Add GError * reporting right down to the plugins (pixbuf/qt)
  * extract: Use a more logical ordered heuristic for caching strings
  * extract: Refactor media_art_process_file() to simplify the function
  * storage: Make g_message() calls g_debug() calls, output is unnecessary
  * docs: Fixed Makefile so we don't fail on distcheck with --enable-gtk-doc
